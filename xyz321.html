   Mikhail Ippolitov-Ivanov (1859&ndash;1935): Procession of the Sardar (1895)
  </h2>
  <p>
   Procession of the Sardar is the final movement of Ippolitov-Ivanov&rsquo;s Caucasian Sketches, Suite No. 1, composed in 1895. A student of Rimsky-Korsakov, Ippolitov-Ivanov developed a deep interest in the folk music of the Caucasus during his years working in Tbilisi (then Tiflis), Georgia. This suite captures the vibrant colors and exotic rhythms of the region while showcasing his talent for orchestration and vivid musical storytelling.
  </p>
  <p>
   The &ldquo;Sardar&rdquo; refers to a Persian or Caucasian military leader or prince, and the piece depicts his grand procession with dignity, stately rhythm, and brilliant fanfares. A commanding trumpet theme sets the tone, supported by rich brass harmonies and steady percussion, while sweeping string lines and colorful woodwind interjections provide contrast and texture. The music conveys a sense of noble pageantry and Eastern grandeur, blending folk-inflected melodies with Russian romantic orchestral color.
  </p>
  <p>
   Procession of the Sardar has become Ippolitov-Ivanov&rsquo;s most frequently performed piece, bringing to life a vision of a distant land and offering a rousing, picturesque close to his Caucasian Sketches.

   Stephen Schwartz (arr. Ted Ricketts): Themes from Wicked
  </h2>
  <p>
   Few Broadway musicals in the 21st century have captured the public&rsquo;s imagination quite like Wicked. Since its premiere in 2003, it has become a cultural phenomenon, drawing millions of theatergoers with its inventive storytelling, compelling characters, and soaring score by composer-lyricist Stephen Schwartz. Based on the novel by Gregory Maguire, Wicked tells the untold story of Elphaba and Glinda&mdash;the witches of Oz&mdash;before Dorothy&rsquo;s arrival, offering a complex narrative of friendship, power, and perception.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ted Ricketts&rsquo; orchestral suite, Themes from Wicked, artfully distills the musical&rsquo;s emotional and dramatic breadth into a symphonic medley that brings Schwartz&rsquo;s music into the concert hall. The arrangement includes five key songs:
  </p>
  <p>
   "No One Mourns the Wicked" sets the tone with its ironic grandeur, casting Elphaba as a villain before her story is truly understood. The music&rsquo;s ceremonial feel contrasts with the audience&rsquo;s growing awareness of the deeper truths behind her actions.
  </p>
  <p>
   "The Wizard and I" follows early in the musical, showcasing Elphaba&rsquo;s initial optimism and belief in the system she longs to be part of. The melody rises with hope and determination, laced with just enough harmonic foreshadowing to hint at her eventual disillusionment.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   "Dancing Through Life" follows, providing a stylish, carefree moment in the musical. Sung by Fiyero, the piece encourages a philosophy of avoiding complexity in favor of pleasure and ease. The orchestral arrangement captures this laid-back, swaggering mood with smooth melodic lines, rhythmic swing, and a sense of buoyant charm that reflects the allure of going through life without attachments or consequences.
  </p>
<p>
   "Popular", one of the show&rsquo;s most comedic and endearing numbers, brings levity and charm. Sung by Glinda as she attempts to give Elphaba a makeover, the song sparkles with syncopated rhythms and playful orchestration, often featuring light woodwinds and pizzicato strings that mirror the bubbly energy of the character.
  </p>
  <p>
   "I'm Not That Girl" provides a moment of emotional contrast&mdash;a quietly poignant solo that expresses Elphaba&rsquo;s inner vulnerability and feelings of isolation. The arrangement gives the strings and solo wind instruments space to sing with lyrical warmth and restraint.
  </p>
  <p>
   Finally, the medley culminates in "Defying Gravity", the show&rsquo;s signature anthem of empowerment and transformation. Here, the orchestra builds gradually to a climactic release, echoing Elphaba&rsquo;s decision to reject the world&rsquo;s labels and take control of her own destiny. Powerful brass writing, driving rhythms, and sweeping textures make this a thrilling closer to the suite.

   Various (arr. Peter Fuchs): A Jewish Tone Poem
  </h2>
  <p>
   This piece was arranged by our Conductor Emeritus, Peter Fuchs, and edited by his son, James Fuchs.  Peter will be performing the piano solo with the orchestra.  The piece is dedicated to the Miami Holocaust Memorial.
  </p>
  <p>
   A tone poem is a musical piece which tells a story. and this is what "a Jewish Tone Poem" intends to do with the aid of familiar musical themes.
  </p>
  <p>
   The story begins in a small Russian village called&nbsp; "Beltz" and describes a peaceful and homey life with&nbsp;the familiar theme "Oif an Pripitshok". Then a sudden strong sound on the Timpani suggests the intrusion&nbsp;of the progroms&nbsp;to shatter their lives and the orchestra plays the dramatic theme " Tell me where can I go" as they have to leave their homes and their lives, But there is hope in the next theme as the Orchestra plays " Jerusalem of Gold" to suggest the return to the Promised Land and as the final end to our  tone poem story, the Orchestra and the piano soloist play the theme from "Exodus" as the end of their journey.

   Aaron Copland (1900&ndash;1990): Variations on a Shaker Melody (1967)
  </h2>
  <p>
   Aaron Copland&rsquo;s Variations on a Shaker Melody is an orchestral arrangement of the beloved Shaker tune &ldquo;Simple Gifts,&rdquo; famously used in his ballet Appalachian Spring. This melody, gentle and dignified, is often associated with American simplicity and optimism, qualities that became central to Copland&rsquo;s musical identity.
  </p>
  <p>
   The piece began as part of Appalachian Spring (1944), where &ldquo;Simple Gifts&rdquo; appears in a set of variations that capture the spirit of rural America. In 1967, Copland extracted and reorchestrated these variations as an independent concert piece, allowing audiences to enjoy the Shaker melody in a focused, standalone form.
  </p>
  <p>
   The theme itself is presented with clarity and directness, followed by variations that add rhythmic energy, harmonic color, and shifting textures while preserving the tune&rsquo;s straightforward charm. Copland&rsquo;s orchestration highlights bright winds, warm strings, and transparent harmonies, reflecting the open landscapes and hopeful spirit often associated with his music.
  </p>
  <p>
   Variations on a Shaker Melody remains a gentle, uplifting work, demonstrating Copland&rsquo;s ability to transform a simple folk tune into a piece of quiet grandeur that resonates with American audiences and beyond.

   Georges Bizet (1838&ndash;1875): Jeux d&rsquo;Enfants (Children&rsquo;s Games), Op. 22 &ndash; Orchestral Suite
  </h2>
  <p>
   In the final years of his tragically short life, Georges Bizet turned his attention to lighter forms, composing the charming Jeux d&rsquo;Enfants (Children&rsquo;s Games) in 1871. Originally written as a twelve-movement suite for piano four hands, the work captures the spirit of childhood with elegance, wit, and melodic charm. A few years later, Bizet orchestrated five of the movements into the orchestral suite most commonly heard today.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rather than depicting specific children or stories, Jeux d&rsquo;Enfants presents a series of musical miniatures, each inspired by a classic toy or game. Though modest in scale, the suite is rich in color and imbued with the kind of rhythmic verve and melodic freshness that would later make Carmen a household name.
  </p>
  <p>
   The five movements of the orchestral suite are:
  </p>
  <p>
   1. Marche (Trumpet and Drum) &ndash; A spirited and playful march, evoking the sight of children parading proudly with toy instruments. It bubbles with brassy energy and rhythmic vigor.
  </p>
  <p>
   2. Berceuse (The Doll) &ndash; A tender lullaby in gentle 6/8 time, this movement cradles the listener in delicate orchestral textures, as if rocking a doll to sleep.
  </p>
  <p>
   3. Impromptu (The Top) &ndash; Quick and nimble, this movement spins with delightful momentum. The music mimics the whirling motion of a toy top with skittering runs and sudden bursts of energy.
  </p>
  <p>
   4. Duo (The Little Husband and Wife) &ndash; A graceful and charming duet, this movement imagines a mock-serious game of pretend marriage, full of innocent affection and lightly humorous interplay.
  </p>
  <p>
   5. Galop (The Ball) &ndash; The suite closes with a vivacious dance, evoking the excitement of a children's ball. Full of sparkle and youthful zest, it ends the suite on a jubilant note.
  </p>
  <p>
   Jeux d&rsquo;Enfants is often admired not only for its delightful portrayal of childhood games but also for the craftsmanship with which Bizet elevates these miniatures into vivid orchestral gems. Though composed as light music, it reveals Bizet&rsquo;s flair for orchestration, thematic development, and character &mdash; qualities that shine throughout his better-known operatic works.

   Jos&eacute; Pablo Moncayo (1912&ndash;1958): Huapango (1941)
  </h2>
  <p>
   Jos&eacute; Pablo Moncayo&rsquo;s Huapango is often called the second national anthem of Mexico for its vibrant, joyful spirit and celebration of Mexican identity. Composed in 1941, it draws its material from the huapango, a lively Mexican dance form from Veracruz characterized by complex rhythms and cross-rhythms between 6/8 and 3/4 time, and the energetic footwork of dancers on a wooden platform.
  </p>
  <p>
   Moncayo based Huapango on three traditional huapango songs&mdash;&ldquo;El Siquisiri,&rdquo; &ldquo;El Balaj&uacute;,&rdquo; and &ldquo;El Gavilancito&rdquo;&mdash;carefully preserving their folk character while crafting a sophisticated orchestral piece. Brilliant brass fanfares, colorful woodwind passages, and pulsing rhythms create a festive, driving energy that rarely pauses, sweeping the listener into the excitement of a Mexican dance celebration.
  </p>
  <p>
   Since its premiere by the Mexico City Philharmonic under Carlos Ch&aacute;vez in 1941, Huapango has become Moncayo&rsquo;s most famous work and a staple of orchestras worldwide, offering audiences a radiant, rhythmically compelling snapshot of Mexican musical tradition in a symphonic frame.
