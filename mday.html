  "Today is Marc's birthday so don't fuck with him!",
  "They say 65 is the new 45, but Marc says it's the appropriate amount of time to take a nap.",
  "When you hit 65, “Rock ‘n Roll” no longer describes your music, but your chair options",
  "You know you’re turning 65 when you start ordering drive-up food at a mailbox.",
  "There once was a Marc who turned 65,\nHis bassoon kept the parties alive,\nWith a wheeze and a puff,\nHe'd play fancy stuff,\nAnd dance with a reed high-five!",
  "Happy 65th, Marc! Time to replace your bassoon with a walker",
  "Advice for 65-year-olds: use valet parking - valets don’t forget where they parked your car.",
  "Marc's bassoon is older than his jokes",
  "Limerick: There once was a Marc quite spry,\nWho played bassoon under the sky,\nAt 65 he would play,\nAnd shout 'Hip Hooray!',\nWhile eating his birthday pie!",
  "At 65, “getting down” on your birthday means not necessarily getting back up.",
  "At 65 your body is still a temple, but the steeples are pointing downward.",
  "At 65, 'getting lucky' means finding your cell phone in your dirty laundry.",
  "What is a prize old people can win for aging? -- Atrophy.",
  "Old age makes us great multitaskers. I can sneeze and pee at the same time.",
  "Why should you marry someone older than you? -- As your looks fade, so will their eyesight.",
  "What’s worse than middle age? Knowing you’ll grow out of it.",
  "You know you're getting old when your doctor refers you to an archaeologist.",
  "Why was the bassoon arrested? -- He was in treble.",
  "Marriage is like playing the bassoon -- it looks easy until you try it.",
  "What do a bassoon and a lawsuit have in common? -- everyone is relieved when the case is closed.",
  "How do you get two bassoonists to play in tune? -- shoot one.",
